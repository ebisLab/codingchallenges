RULE 1
-------
Alaways assume worst case

RULE 2
-------
Drop the constants

RULE 3
-------
Different terms for inputs

RULE 4
-------
Drop non dominant terms


Good code should be:
Readable
Speed - Time complexity -efficient
Memory - Space complexity -efficient'  -stack overflow

*there's usually trade off between time and memory.
less time? more memory
less memory, more time


** What causes space complexity?
variables
data structures
function calls
allocations



***space complexity ****
