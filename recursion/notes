function that calls itself
How it helps solve problems:
helps with tasks that have repeated sub tasks

Found in Serching ans sorting:
Traversing a tree

stack overflow

there's usually a base case

pops functions off the stack 


DRY
Readability

Drawback
Large stack
recursive- adds extra piece of memory
            -Tail call optimization - Allows recursions to be called without increasing the call stack


When to use it
--------------
Tree data structure when doing traversal
when you don't know how many times you loop. 
*Everytime you are using a tree or converting something into a tree.
    *A problem can be didivided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem
    *Each instances of the subproblems is identical in nature
    *The solution of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand. 

    Divide and conquer -> split it in the middle  . or go to that section it may contain and start solving. 

They can make task
