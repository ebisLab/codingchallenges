*Similar to linked list except with multiple next nodes
*Special type of graph

Used for
--------
*search
*printing
*callbacks


Search -> completed when the target of the search is found
Traversal -> completed when EVERY node has been explored


Depth First Traversal
---------------------
Continues traveling forward on each branch until a dead end is reached. 
It then retreats to the first unexplored branch and follows the next unexplored path until that one too reaches a dead end.
Continues until ALL nodes have been visited. 
(kind of like being in a maze)
we can use recursive or iteratively... iterative approach makes use of stack


Breadth First Traversal
-----------------------
Explores layer by layer. Slowly moving outward from starting point. 
Each node we add every node we discover to the list of nodes to explore, then explore them in the order inw hich we encounter them. -> queue
We jump around a bit. Next node might not be directly connected to the one we're on


Sequential Search -- Linear Search
